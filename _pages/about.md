I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Liverpool. I hold a Master of Research degree in Economics awarded by University of Southampton. My undergrad was completed in 2018 at the Sichuan University. My work mainly relates to urban economics, labour economics and industrial organization, with a particular interest in how new technologies reshape spatial economic activity and the behavior of traditional service sectors. I am broadly interested in how platform innovations, changes in mobility, and evolving urban infrastructure influence the allocation of economic activity within cities.

My job market paper examines how ride-sharing platforms influence hotel performance across urban space. Using a staggered difference-in-differences framework with granular zip code-level data from six U.S. cities, I show that Uber’s entry raises hotel prices, with the largest gains concentrated in neighbourhoods with moderate but incomplete transit access. These findings highlight an overlooked cross-sector mechanism: ride-hailing acts as a complement to existing transport networks, expanding the effective market reach of hotels by reducing last-mile frictions.

Outside my job market paper, I am working on projects that examine how digital platforms shape urban safety and neighbourhood dynamics. One study investigates whether Uber’s expansion affects crime against women by altering nighttime mobility and exposure to risk. My research also relies heavily on large-scale data processing and geospatial analysis: I regularly use Python, R, Stata, and GIS tools to integrate administrative, spatial, and industry datasets. These methods allow me to analyse urban behaviour at a fine spatial resolution.

I am on the job market in the academic year 2025-2026
