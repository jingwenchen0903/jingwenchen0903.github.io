I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Liverpool. I hold a Master of Research degree in Economics awarded by University of Southampton. My undergrad was completed in 2018 at the Sichuan University. 

My work mainly relates to urban economics, labour economics and industrial organization. I am currently exploring how crime, organized crime and the public policies to address them affect social outcomes and voting behaviour, utilizing georeferenced and historical data. My job market paper examines how ride-sharing platforms influence hotel performance across urban space. Using a staggered difference-in-differences framework with granular zip code-level data from six U.S. cities, I show that Uber’s entry raises hotel prices, with the largest gains concentrated in neighbourhoods with moderate but incomplete transit access. These findings highlight an overlooked cross-sector mechanism: ride-hailing acts as a complement to existing transport networks, expanding the effective market reach of hotels by reducing last-mile frictions.

I am on the job market in the academic year 2025-2026
