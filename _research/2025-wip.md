excerpt: "This project examines how major transport improvements affect educational inequality, with a particular focus on pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). This work exploit the opening of the Elizabeth Line in 2022 as a large accessibility shock for schools located near new stations. Using school-level data on absence, attainment, and pupil composition, the project will study whether improved transport connections reduce attendance barriers and narrow disadvantage gaps—especially in schools serving high-SEND and high-FSM populations. This research contributes to understanding how transport infrastructure can improve inclusion and reduce spatial inequality in education."

## Abstract

This project examines how major transport improvements affect educational inequality, with a particular focus on pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND). This work exploit the opening of the Elizabeth Line in 2022 as a large accessibility shock for schools located near new stations. Using school-level data on absence, attainment, and pupil composition, the project will study whether improved transport connections reduce attendance barriers and narrow disadvantage gaps—especially in schools serving high-SEND and high-FSM populations. This research contributes to understanding how transport infrastructure can improve inclusion and reduce spatial inequality in education.
