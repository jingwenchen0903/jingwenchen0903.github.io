excerpt: "My job market paper examines how Uber’s entry reshapes the spatial distribution of hotel performance. Using a staggered difference-in-differences design with zip code–level data from six U.S. cities, I show that Uber raises hotel prices—driven not by distance to the city centre, but by improvements in functional accessibility. The largest gains occur in neighbourhoods with moderate but incomplete transit coverage, where ride-hailing most effectively reduces last-mile frictions. These findings reveal a previously overlooked cross-sector mechanism through which mobility platforms reallocate urban economic activity."
